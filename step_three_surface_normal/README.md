Surface normals
--------
 At the beginning we need to get ourselves an surface normal, to make a shade. In three dimensions, a surface normal, or simply normal, to a surface at a point P is a vector that is perpendicular to the tangent plane to that surface at P. The word "normal" is also used as an adjective: a line normal to a plane, the normal component of a force, the normal vector, etc.
