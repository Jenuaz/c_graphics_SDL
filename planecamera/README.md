Rays, a simple camera, and background
--------
Letâ€™s think of a ray as a function p(t) = A + t*B. Here p is a 3D position along a line. 
A is the ray origin and B is the ray direction. The ray parameter t is a real number.
Plug in a different t and p(t) moves the point along the ray. For positive t, you get 
only the parts in front of A, and this is a ray.
