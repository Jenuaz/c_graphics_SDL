# Chapter 1: Output an image
Whenever you start a renderer, you need a way to see an image. The most straightforward way
is to write it to a file. The catch is, there are so many formats and many of those are complex.
So I decide to create simple gradient visualizer. Main code stored in ft_core() function in ft_core file;
